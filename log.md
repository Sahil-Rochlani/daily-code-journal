### 📚 Topics:
- Binary Tree Traversals & Structural Properties
- Depth-first Recursion
- Height / Balance Checking
- Optimized Tree Logic

---

### 🧠 Questions Solved:

2. **Right Side View**
   - DFS with level tracking to push the first visible node from the right per level.

### Day 21 – July 11, 2025

### ✅ What I did today:

- 🌲 Continued gaining comfort with tree traversal patterns and base case intuition.
- 💡 Understood when and why recursion stays O(N) despite branching.
- 🧪 Practiced identifying base conditions and applying backtracking correctly.

---

### 📚 Questions Solved:

1. **Check if a Binary Tree is Height Balanced**
   - Used recursive depth check for each subtree.
   - Time complexity: O(N²) due to repeated depth calculations.
   - Plan to optimize using a bottom-up approach later.

2. **Lowest Common Ancestor of Two Nodes**
   - Classic recursive approach with subtree analysis.
   - If one node is found in each subtree, current node is LCA.
   - Time complexity: O(N)

3. **Check if a Path With Given Sum Exists**
   - Simple recursive check for root-to-leaf path with target sum.
   - Base condition checks if `targetSum - val == 0` at a leaf.
   - Time complexity: O(N)

4. **Find All Root-to-Leaf Paths With Given Sum**
   - Backtracking approach using path vector and DFS.
   - Appended path when valid, then backtracked using `pop_back()`.
   - Time complexity: O(N²) in worst case due to copying paths.

---

### 🧠 Notes:
- Tree recursion feels more natural now — able to write and trace logic confidently.
- Learned to identify where backtracking is needed vs. plain recursion.

- 🛡️ Added protections to ensure only professors can manage their own slots and appointments.
- ⛔ Prevented double bookings and ensured unbooking logic works on appointment cancellation.

---

### 💡 Key Concepts:
- Controller responsibility separation: slot creation, appointment booking, and cancellation in isolated functions.
- Date validation and comparison to avoid booking past slots.
- `populate` usage to fetch related documents like professor/student info cleanly.
- Ensured `isBooked` is reset when an appointment is canceled.

---

- 🧱 Finalized Mongoose schemas for `User`, `Slot`, and `Appointment`.
- ♻️ Revised all DSA problems solved during the week — reinforced stack, LL, and sorting logic.

---

### 💡 Key Concepts:
- Middleware pattern: token check (`authenticate`) vs role control (`authorizeRole(...roles)`).
- Schema design choices: normalized references vs duplication (slot → appointment → professor).
- Used single `slotTime` as `Date` for better sorting/filtering.

---

### 🧠 Notes:
- Feeling much more confident with backend flow now.
- Logic feels lighter now that structure is clean.
- Excited to build out controllers and wire the full flow next.
