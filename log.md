## Day 6 – June 26, 2025
- Solved the “Asteroid Collision” problem (Stack)  
- Felt like 10x effort due to poor sleep and nervous system flares  
- Still showed up and got it done — consistency over comfort



## Day 5 - June 25, 2025
- Implemented recursive function to print middle element of a stack
- Wrote logic to check if a stack is sorted (preserving stack)
- Solved:
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Redundant Parentheses


- Didn't do a lot, but didn’t skip either. Slowly building consistency.

## Day 4 - June 24, 2025
- Practiced Stack problems:
  - Sort a stack
  - Check if Word is Valid After Substitutions
  - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  - Minimum Bracket Reversals
  - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates
- Started logging everything properly ✍️

## Day 3 - June 23, 2025
- Stack Implementation using Linked List
- Insert at bottom of stack (recursively)
- Reverse a stack
- Couldn’t do a lot today due to a health flare-up, but still showed up 🙌

## Day 2 - June 22, 2025
- Revised all 28 Linked List questions I solved over the weekend.
- Practiced recursion using:
  - House Robber II (got TLE but understood the logic)
  - Count Derangements (backtracking + recursion practice)
- Focusing on understanding recursive flow more clearly.

## Day 1 - June 21, 2025
- Solved 6 Linked List problems:
  - Flatten a Multilevel Linked List
  - Sort a Linked List (Merge Sort)
  - Merge Nodes Between Zeros
  - Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes
  - Intersection Point of Two LLs
  - Nodes Between Critical Points
- 🚀 First day of #100DaysOfCode!
