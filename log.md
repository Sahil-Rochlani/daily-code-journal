### Day 9 - June 29, 2025

### ✅ What I did today:
- 🧠 Designed **Browser History** (both 2-stack and pointer/index-based approaches).
- 🔁 Implemented **Queue using Stack** (optimized with two stacks).
- 📁 Solved **Simplify Path** (manually and explored `stringstream + getline` method).
- 🧩 Solved **Sudoku Solver** using backtracking.
- ☎️ Solved **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number** using recursion + hashmap.

### 💡 Key Concepts:
- Stack-based design & backtracking recursion.
- Explored string parsing using `stringstream` for path simplification.
- Improved understanding of recursive tree generation (letter combinations).
- Getting more comfortable with clean, optimal stack logic.

### 📌 Notes:
- Today was a tough one mentally. Couldn’t think clearly at times.
- Still pushed through and solved questions step-by-step.
- Getting stuck is frustrating, but I’m proud I showed up and tried.

## Day 8 - June 28, 2025

### ✅ What I did today:
- 🔁 Implemented circular deque.
- 🌡️ Solved **Daily Temperatures** using a monotonic stack.
- 🔢 Solved **Next Greater Node In Linked List** using recursion + stack.
- 🧮 Tried solving **Remove K Digits** — learned it's a greedy problem, struggled due to not having done greedy yet. Had to watch the video to understand it.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Solved **Celebrity Problem**
- 📈 Solved **Stock Span Problem** — understood and implemented the optimal monotonic stack solution.

### 💡 Key Concepts:
- Monotonic Stack for efficient span/next element type problems.
- Streaming/online questions where you maintain state.
- Greedy intuition still needs work; will explore soon.
- Still showing up despite health and mental fatigue.

### 📌 Notes:
- Some questions were hard to think through due to health fog.
- Watched video for “Remove K Digits” — greedy is hard without prior exposure.

## Day 7 — June 27, 2025

✅ Practiced Monotonic Stack Patterns:
- 🔸 Next Smaller Element
- 🔸 Previous Smaller Element
- 🔸 Largest Rectangle in Histogram (Optimized using NSE/PSE logic)

✅ Learned Queue Data Structure:
- 🔹 Basics and operations (push, pop, front, rear)
- 🔹 Implemented Normal Queue using Arrays
- 🔹 Implemented Circular Queue
- 🔹 Implemented Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

🧠 Key Learnings:
- How monotonic stacks help optimize brute-force O(N^2) rectangle area to O(N)
- Queue edge cases: full/empty detection, circular wrap-around logic
- Deque flexibility and array limitations in push_front/back handling

⏱️ Progress wasn't rushed — stayed consistent, kept building.

## Day 6 – June 26, 2025
- Solved the “Asteroid Collision” problem (Stack)  
- Felt like 10x effort due to poor sleep and nervous system flares  
- Still showed up and got it done — consistency over comfort

---

## Day 5 - June 25, 2025
- Implemented recursive function to print middle element of a stack
- Wrote logic to check if a stack is sorted (preserving stack)
- Solved:
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Redundant Parentheses


- Didn't do a lot, but didn’t skip either. Slowly building consistency.

---

## Day 4 - June 24, 2025
- Practiced Stack problems:
  - Sort a stack
  - Check if Word is Valid After Substitutions
  - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  - Minimum Bracket Reversals
  - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates
- Started logging everything properly ✍️

---

## Day 3 - June 23, 2025
- Stack Implementation using Linked List
- Insert at bottom of stack (recursively)
- Reverse a stack
- Couldn’t do a lot today due to a health flare-up, but still showed up 🙌

---

## Day 2 - June 22, 2025
- Revised all 28 Linked List questions I solved over the weekend.
- Practiced recursion using:
  - House Robber II (got TLE but understood the logic)
  - Count Derangements (backtracking + recursion practice)
- Focusing on understanding recursive flow more clearly.

---

## Day 1 - June 21, 2025
- Solved 6 Linked List problems:
  - Flatten a Multilevel Linked List
  - Sort a Linked List (Merge Sort)
  - Merge Nodes Between Zeros
  - Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes
  - Intersection Point of Two LLs
  - Nodes Between Critical Points
- 🚀 First day of #100DaysOfCode!
