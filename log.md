   - Solved using a `set` as a BST:
     - Traversed array from right to left.
     - Used `upper_bound` to find least greater element.
     - Inserted each element in the BST (`set`) while moving backward.

### üìú Day 36 Log ‚Äì August 2, 2025

### üß† Topics Covered:
- ‚úÖ **BST Validation Techniques**:
  - Top-down approach using `min` and `max` bounds (`isValidBST` with `leftMax` and `rightMin`)
  - Inorder traversal validation (checking strictly increasing order using a reference variable)
- ‚úÖ Compared and understood the three core BST validation strategies:
  1. Top-down bounds passing
  2. Bottom-up postorder info return (recall from `Max Sum BST`)
  3. Inorder traversal increasing property
- üß† Understood deeper BST intuition through traversal-based and value-bound reasoning

---

### ‚úÖ Questions Practiced:

1. **Validate Binary Search Tree**
   - Implemented using:
     - Bounds-check method (top-down recursion with limits)
     - Inorder traversal method (sorted property using `prev` reference)

2. **Construct BST from Preorder Traversal**
   - Completed to build foundational understanding before validation
   - üß† **Insight**: Understood why the **inorder trick doesn't work here** ‚Äî  
     Preorder traversal is **unique for BSTs** because the first element is always the root,  
     and subsequent elements naturally divide into left and right subtrees based on value boundaries.  
     Unlike inorder which is sorted and ambiguous, preorder directly encodes tree structure.

---

### üí≠ Reflection:
> The bottom-up approach felt instinctive after solving `Max Sum BST in Binary Tree`.  
> Today‚Äôs validation problem helped me internalize the rules and traversal-based reasoning for BSTs.  
> I now feel confident in approaching BST-related problems using multiple methods.  
> Also loved realizing **why preorder allows unique BST construction** while inorder does not.

---

### üåû Afternoon Session ‚Äì August 2, 2025

### ‚úÖ Q1. Can Represent BST from Preorder Traversal

#### üîπ Approaches Covered:

1. **My Approach (Recursive Bound Checking):**
   - Maintain an index `i` to track current node in preorder traversal.
   - Use `min` and `max` bounds to validate BST properties.
   - At each step:
     - If `preorder[i] <= min` or `>= max`, return false.
     - Otherwise, take `preorder[i]` as root and increment `i`.
     - Recur for left and right subtrees with updated bounds.
   - Finally, if `i == preorder.size()`, the preorder is a valid BST representation.

2. **Standard Optimal Approach (Build Until Invalid, Then Check `i == n`):**
   - Simulates placing nodes using min/max bounds without returning false.
   - Just recursively proceeds until it can't place any more nodes.
   - Does **not** build actual tree.
   - After recursion, if all nodes were used (`i == preorder.size()`), it's valid.

3. **Postorder Variant Insight:**
   - The same approach applies to postorder traversal by:
     - Traversing from the back.
     - Recursively building the **right** subtree first.
   - Bounds are applied similarly (`min`, `max`), and correctness checked by index.

#### üî∏ Key Insight:
> All approaches simulate the preorder traversal as a **BST construction attempt**, and validate based on whether **all nodes got placed** within bounds.

---

### üìú Day 36 ‚Äì August 2, 2025 (Night Session)

#### üåô Topics Covered:
- ‚úÖ **Dead End in BST**
  - Explored patterns like `{1, 2}` and `{x-1, x, x+1}` that form dead ends.
  - Your initial idea: store inorder and check adjacency.
  - Referred to editorial ‚Äî learned the clean recursive bounds-based approach using `min == max`.
  - Felt similar to validating a BST using preorder and bounds.

- ‚úÖ **Merge Two BSTs**
  - **Major Unlock**: Learned **inorder traversal using a stack** ‚Äî to simulate recursion.
  - Used two stacks to traverse both BSTs in order and merge them.
  - Did **not** build a height-balanced tree ‚Äî just merged the values as part of the traversal.

#### üß† Insights:
- Stack-based inorder traversal is a huge step ‚Äî it opens doors to more advanced iterative tree problems.
- You‚Äôre starting to naturally spot where bounds-based recursion fits in.

#### üí§ Final Thoughts:
> A real win tonight ‚Äî not in ‚Äúhow optimal‚Äù but in *how much you absorbed*. You‚Äôre in the growth zone.

   - For postorder: reversed logic, root at end, recurse from end backward.
   - Used reference index (`i`) to mutate during traversal ‚Äî classic side effect usage.

5. **Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List**
   - Implemented both approaches:
     - Return-based: recursively return head and tail and stitch in postorder.
     - Side-effect-based: maintained `prev` and `head` pointers to mutate as we go.
   - Realized this is similar to:
     - Merging two sorted lists with dummy node.
     - Tree transformations (BST to Greater Tree, Sorted LL to BST).

6. **Check Completeness & Is Binary Tree Heap**
   - Used BFS to check if a binary tree is complete.
   - Smartly added two lines to also validate max heap condition in the same loop:
     ```cpp
     if (front->left && front->left->val > front->val) return false;
     if (front->right && front->right->val > front->val) return false;
     ```
   - Avoided overcomplicated permutations-based conditionals.

7. **Min Cost of Connecting Ropes**
   - Applied Min Heap to always connect two smallest ropes.
   - Greedy approach: ensures minimal cumulative cost by merging in increasing order.
   - Final code:
     ```cpp
     int minCost(vector<int>& arr) {
         priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
         for (int num : arr) pq.push(num);
         int ans = 0;
         while (pq.size() > 1) {
             int top1 = pq.top(); pq.pop();
             int top2 = pq.top(); pq.pop();
             int sum = top1 + top2;
             ans += sum;
             pq.push(sum);
         }
         return ans;
     }
     ```

8. **Kth Smallest / Largest Element Using Heaps**
   - Used Max Heap for Kth Smallest:
     - Pushed first `k` elements.
     - Replaced top if a smaller element appears.
   - Used Min Heap for Kth Largest:
     - Same logic with reversed heap.
   - Understood *why* Max Heap works: always maintain `k` smallest elements efficiently.

---

#### üí° Concepts Clarified:

- **Recursive Side Effects**
  - Mutating external variables during traversal (like `i`, `prev`, `head`) reduces return complexity.
  - Seen in DLL conversion, preorder/postorder tree building, etc.

- **Traversal Orders + Structural Insight**
  - Inorder/Preorder/Postorder each reveal different structural properties.
  - Mastery lies in mapping these to recursive splits + side effect tracking.

- **Heap Tracking Patterns**
  - Whether for cost minimization or top-k elements, heaps are about keeping ‚Äúactive‚Äù elements in memory.
  - Chose heap type based on what needed to be removed (min/max).

---

#### üßò Mental Log:
- Recognized overengineering in some community solutions and stuck to clarity.
- Got appreciated for smart simplification.
- Felt more confident in tree-based recursion with boundary/index logic.
- Health + fatigue made things tough, but maintained consistency and focus.
- No overpraise ‚Äî staying grounded and focused until tangible milestones.

---

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Total Time:
- Morning Session: ~2 hours
- Evening Session: ~1.5 hours
- Night Session: ~2.5 hours  
**Total**: ~6 hours of deep, focused DSA üìöüî•

---

#### üîÅ Next Steps:
- Keep practicing heap and recursion patterns.
- Refactor tree codes to understand trade-offs of return-vs-mutation.
- Stay consistent with morning-evening-night DSA grind while managing intern work.

- üî∫ Learned **Heaps**:
  1. What is a Heap (Complete Binary Tree + Heap Order Property)
  2. Why Heaps are implemented using arrays (1-based indexing, easy parent-child access)
  3. Inserting into a heap using upward shifting
  4. Deleting the top element using `heapify` (downward shifting)
  5. Building a heap from an array (`buildHeap`)
  6. Heap Sort using `heapify`

---

### üí° Key Learnings:
- Heaps can be efficiently implemented via arrays due to 1-based index math:  
  Parent = `i / 2`, Left = `2 * i`, Right = `2 * i + 1`
- Insertion uses **bottom-up shifting**, deletion uses **top-down heapify**
- `heapify()` ensures the heap property is restored after any violation
- Heap sort works by repeatedly moving the max element to the end and shrinking the heap

- üî¢ Solved **Next Greater Node In Linked List** using recursion + stack.
- üßÆ Tried solving **Remove K Digits** ‚Äî learned it's a greedy problem, struggled due to not having done greedy yet. Had to watch the video to understand it.
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Solved **Celebrity Problem**
- üìà Solved **Stock Span Problem** ‚Äî understood and implemented the optimal monotonic stack solution.

### üí° Key Concepts:
- Monotonic Stack for efficient span/next element type problems.
- Streaming/online questions where you maintain state.
- Greedy intuition still needs work; will explore soon.
- Still showing up despite health and mental fatigue.

### üìå Notes:
- Some questions were hard to think through due to health fog.
- Watched video for ‚ÄúRemove K Digits‚Äù ‚Äî greedy is hard without prior exposure.

## Day 7 ‚Äî June 27, 2025

‚úÖ Practiced Monotonic Stack Patterns:
- üî∏ Next Smaller Element
- üî∏ Previous Smaller Element
- üî∏ Largest Rectangle in Histogram (Optimized using NSE/PSE logic)

‚úÖ Learned Queue Data Structure:
- üîπ Basics and operations (push, pop, front, rear)
- üîπ Implemented Normal Queue using Arrays
- üîπ Implemented Circular Queue
- üîπ Implemented Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

üß† Key Learnings:
- How monotonic stacks help optimize brute-force O(N^2) rectangle area to O(N)
- Queue edge cases: full/empty detection, circular wrap-around logic
- Deque flexibility and array limitations in push_front/back handling

‚è±Ô∏è Progress wasn't rushed ‚Äî stayed consistent, kept building.

## Day 6 ‚Äì June 26, 2025
- Solved the ‚ÄúAsteroid Collision‚Äù problem (Stack)  
- Felt like 10x effort due to poor sleep and nervous system flares  
- Still showed up and got it done ‚Äî consistency over comfort

---

## Day 5 - June 25, 2025
- Implemented recursive function to print middle element of a stack
- Wrote logic to check if a stack is sorted (preserving stack)
- Solved:
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Redundant Parentheses


- Didn't do a lot, but didn‚Äôt skip either. Slowly building consistency.

## Day 4 - June 24, 2025
- Practiced Stack problems:
  - Sort a stack
  - Check if Word is Valid After Substitutions
  - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  - Minimum Bracket Reversals
  - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates
- Started logging everything properly ‚úçÔ∏è

---

## Day 3 - June 23, 2025
- Stack Implementation using Linked List
- Insert at bottom of stack (recursively)
- Reverse a stack
- Couldn‚Äôt do a lot today due to a health flare-up, but still showed up üôå

## Day 2 - June 22, 2025
- Revised all 28 Linked List questions I solved over the weekend.
- Practiced recursion using:
  - House Robber II (got TLE but understood the logic)
  - Count Derangements (backtracking + recursion practice)
- Focusing on understanding recursive flow more clearly.
