## Day 5 - [Date]

**DSA Practice:**
- Implemented recursive function to print middle element of a stack
- Wrote logic to check if a stack is sorted (preserving stack)
- Solved:
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Redundant Parentheses

**Reflections:**
Didn't do a lot, but didn’t skip either. Slowly building consistency.

## Day 4 - June 24, 2025
- Practiced Stack problems:
  - Sort a stack
  - Check if Word is Valid After Substitutions
  - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  - Minimum Bracket Reversals
  - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates
- Started logging everything properly ✍️

## Day 3 - June 23, 2025
- Stack Implementation using Linked List
- Insert at bottom of stack (recursively)
- Reverse a stack
- Couldn’t do a lot today due to a health flare-up, but still showed up 🙌

## Day 2 - June 22, 2025
- Revised all 28 Linked List questions I solved over the weekend.
- Practiced recursion using:
  - House Robber II (got TLE but understood the logic)
  - Count Derangements (backtracking + recursion practice)
- Focusing on understanding recursive flow more clearly.
