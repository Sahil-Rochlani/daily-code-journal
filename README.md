# ðŸ§  Daily Code Journal

A personal log of my daily progress as I learn and build.

This journal covers everything I practice â€” from DSA to web dev, and anything in between. My goal is to stay consistent and track how far I've come, one day at a time.

### ðŸ“Œ Why this log?

Sometimes I go slow, sometimes I canâ€™t push hard â€” but I **show up every day** and make progress that matters.

This repo helps me prove that to myself.
