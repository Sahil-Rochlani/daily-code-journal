Hereâ€™s a list of must-know interview patterns and tricks involving stacks when dealing with trees and BSTs:

âœ… 1. Iterative Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
Using a stack instead of recursion:

Inorder: Left â†’ Root â†’ Right (explained above)

Preorder: Root â†’ Left â†’ Right
â†’ push root, then push right, then left

Postorder: Left â†’ Right â†’ Root
â†’ trickier, often uses two stacks or reverse preorder

You should practice all three iteratively.

âœ… 2. Simultaneous Inorder Traversal (Two BST Merge)
As youâ€™re working on:
Use two stacks to simulate two inorder traversals at once and merge them.

âœ… 3. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List (Leetcode 114)
This is basically preorder traversal, done with a stack and pointer rewiring.
ðŸ‘‰ Convert tree into a "right-skewed" list in-place using stack.

âœ… 4. Valid BST Iterator (Leetcode 173)
Design a class that uses a stack internally to do lazy inorder traversal:

cpp
Copy
Edit
BSTIterator it(root);
it.next(); it.hasNext();
You're expected to manage the stack manually and return elements one-by-one in sorted order (inorder).

âœ… 5. Postorder Using One Stack
A famous interview follow-up is:
ðŸ‘‰ "Can you do postorder traversal with just one stack?"

This requires tracking the last visited node and carefully controlling when to push or pop.

âœ… 6. Recover BST (Leetcode 99)
Two nodes in a BST are swapped by mistake.
Inorder should be sorted â€” use inorder + stack to spot the two misplaced nodes and recover them.

âœ… 7. Morris Traversal (Advanced, O(1) space)
Not stack-based, but a follow-up to iterative traversal questions.
It threads the tree temporarily to avoid recursion/stack and uses O(1) space.

âœ… 8. Next Greater Element in Tree
Some problems ask you to find the next greater node for each node â€” similar to next greater element in array, but now with tree structure â€” and stack-based logic is reused.
